# Silly-Fun-Stupid
A collection of random code and programs used for trivial calculations and personal questions.

Here you will find things like, "would a squirrell survive a fall from space?"
"A simple bot using selenium to communicate with best buy's servers in order to obtain an RTX3080"
And others as this will be continuously added onto the further into my programming journey I continue.
